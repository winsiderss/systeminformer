3. **Originality of Work**. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original

else for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent. 
If Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has 
intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure 
permission from Your employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case, 
the term “You” in this Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change 
employers in the future and desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then 
You agree to sign a new Agreement and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting 
those Submissions.

    the Submission directly or indirectly from Winsider Seminars & Solutions, Inc., a perpetual, 
    worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the Submission to reproduce,

    necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the Submission with the Project 
    to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import or otherwise 
    dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.

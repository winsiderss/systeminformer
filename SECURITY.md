Informer project.

  * [Reporting a Bug](#reporting-a-bug)

## Reporting a Bug

The System Informer team considers security our top priority and reviews all
reports of vulnerabilities or security issues very seriously.

We appreciate responsible disclosure efforts and are committed to acknowledging
your contributions.

If you discover a security issue, please send a report by emailing
security@systeminformer.com or security@systeminformer.io.

The System Informer team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will
send a more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask
for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the System Informer team receives a security bug report, they will assign
it to a primary developer. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Seek review from respected third-party security experts.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible.

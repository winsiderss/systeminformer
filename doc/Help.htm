    <p><em><strong>Process Hacker</strong></em></p>

    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker is a tool to view and manipulate processes, services and network connections. It is not intended 
    for system optimization, and general users may find many concepts referred to unfamiliar.</p>

    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Vista or 7 (Windows XP SP3 and Windows Vista SP1 required for certain features)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that some features may be unavailable on 64-bit systems. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bypassing rootkits and security software when accessing processes, threads and other objects.</li>
      <li>Viewing kernel pool limits</li>
      <li>Viewing hidden processes</li>
      <li>Changing handle attributes</li>
      <li>Viewing kernel-mode stack traces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Configuration File</h2>
    <p>The settings file for Process Hacker is stored in: <code>[Roaming Application Data]\Process Hacker 2</code>.</p>

    <h2>Command Line Options</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>-hide</dt>
      <dd>Starts Process Hacker hidden, regardless of any settings.</dd>
      <dt>-installkph</dt>
      <dd>Installs the KProcessHacker service.</dd>
      <dt>-nokph</dt>
      <dd>Disables KProcessHacker temporarily.</dd>

      <dd>Starts Process Hacker visible, regardless of any settings.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="options">Options</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker's options are accessible from the <strong>Options</strong> menu item 
    in the <strong>Hacker</strong> menu.</p>
    
    <h2>General</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Search Engine</dt>
      <dd>This is used by the <strong>Search Online...</strong> menu item in the process and module 
      context menus. <code>%s</code> is replaced by the name of the selected process or module.</dd>
      
      <dt>PE Viewer</dt>
      <dd>This is used by the <strong>Inspect</strong> menu item for modules. <code>%s</code> is 
      replaced by the name of the selected module.</dd>
      
      <dt>Max. Size Unit</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the maximum unit of size; sizes which can be displayed as 1024 or less in a 
      smaller unit will be displayed in that smaller unit, while sizes requiring a larger unit will 
      use units up to the maximum unit specified here.</dd>
      
      <dt>Icon Processes</dt>
      <dd>The number of processes to display in the notification icon menu.</dd>
      
      <dt>Allow only one instance</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will allow only one instance of itself. Any attempts to start 
      a new instance will show the existing instance.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when closed</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide itself when it is closed. You 
      can double-click on the notification icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when minimized</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide itself when it is minimized. You 
      can double-click on the notification icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Start hidden</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will start hidden. You can double-click on the notification 
      icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Collapse services on start</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will collapse the services.exe tree, hiding all services 
      at startup.</dd>
      
      <dt>Single-click icons</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will show/hide itself with only a single click on its tray 
      icons. Otherwise, a double-click is needed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Enable process database</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will provide additional features but will take longer to 
      start. Currently the only additional feature available is to mark processes as safe/unsafe.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Advanced</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Enable warnings</dt>
      <dd>If disabled, Process Hacker will not show confirmation prompts for most actions.</dd>
      
      <dt>Enable kernel-mode driver</dt>
      <dd>Some handles cannot be displayed by a user-mode program like Process Hacker; this 
      option enables <em>KProcessHacker</em> which allows Process Hacker 
      to display all handles and bypass rootkits/security software. If enabled, it will be 
      loaded the next time Process Hacker is started. This currently has no effect on 64-bit 
      systems.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide unnamed handles</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, unnamed handles will be hidden by default. This can be changed in each 
      process properties window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Replace Task Manager with Process Hacker</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, any attempt to start Task Manager will start Process Hacker instead.</dd>
      
      <dt>Check images for digital signatures and packing</dt>
      <dd>(Recommended) If enabled, Process Hacker will check process images for digital signatures 
      and determine whether they are packed. Note that this may cause internet access on some systems.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Symbols</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Dbghelp.dll path</dt>
      <dd>Select the path to the most recent version of dbghelp.dll you have 
      installed on your computer. If you do not have the latest version, go to 
      <code>http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx</code> and 
      download Debugging Tools for Windows.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search path</dt>
      <dd>Type in a symbol server path. Most users will want to use the following: 
      <code>SRV*<strong>C:\Users\USERNAME\Symbols</strong>*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</code>. 
      This will have any needed symbols downloaded from Microsoft's symbol server to 
      the specified directory (in bold).</dd>
      
      <dt>Undecorate symbols</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, C++ symbol names will be undecorated (unmangled). This is most 
      useful for methods with complex signatures.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Highlighting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Highlighting Duration</dt>
      <dd>This specifies the amount of time for which new and removed objects (processes, threads and services) 
      are highlighted in a different color.</dd>
      
      <dt>New Objects</dt>
      <dd>New processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions, and handles.</dd>
      
      <dt>Removed Objects</dt>
      <dd>Terminated/deleted processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions and 
      handles.</dd>

      <dd>Processes associated with a job object.</dd>
      
      <dt>POSIX Processes</dt>
      <dd>POSIX subsystem processes (also known as Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications).</dd>
      
      <dt>Debugged Processes</dt>
      <dd>Processes currently being debugged.</dd>
      
      <dt>Elevated Processes</dt>
      <dd>Processes running with full privileges on a computer with 
      User Account Control (UAC) enabled.</dd>
      
      <dt>Suspended Processes and Threads</dt>
      <dd>Processes and threads which have been suspended.</dd>
      
      <dt>.NET Processes and DLLs</dt>
      <dd>Managed (.NET) processes and DLLs/modules.</dd>
      
      <dt>Packed Processes</dt>
      <dd>Processes with packed images. These processes are sometimes malicious, but normal executables are 
      often packed to reduce their size.</dd>
      
      <dt>GUI Threads</dt>

      <dt>Protected Handles</dt>
      <dd>Handles which are protected from being closed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Inherit Handles</dt>
      <dd>Handles which will be inherited by child processes.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Graphs</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Show Text</dt>
      <dd>If disabled, Process Hacker will not show text representing the current usage for each graph.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="numberinput">Number Input</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker supports the input of numbers in various bases (including some non-standard
    extensions).</p>
    <p>A number is assumed to be in base 10 unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It starts with <code>0</code> (zero) - octal (base 8)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>0x</code> - hexadecimal (base 16)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>b</code> - binary (base 2)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>t</code> - ternary (base 3)</li>		
      <li>It starts with <code>q</code> - quaternary (base 4)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>w</code> - base 12</li>				
      <li>It starts with <code>r</code> - base 32</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1 id="proctree">Process Tree</h1>
    <p>The process tree displays processes running on the system as a tree; processes started by a 
    particular parent process are shown indented below it. Processes with a non-existent parent 
    (where its parent has terminated) are shown on the far left. You can manipulate processes by 
    right-clicking on them, and you can show detailed properties for a process by double-clicking 
    it or selecting the "Properties..." menu item.</p>
    
    <p>You can sort by the various columns by clicking on them - the tree view will temporarily 
    become a flat list. You can click the same column again to sort in the reverse order, and 
    once more to return to the tree view.</p>
    
    <p>Like Process Explorer, Process Hacker shows Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs) and Interrupts 
    in the process tree. The only information these "processes" show is their CPU usage.</p>
    
    <h2>Process Tooltips</h2>
    <p>If you hover the mouse over a process' name, a tooltip appears with useful information:</p>
    <dl>

      <dd>Allows you to manipulate the process' window, if one was found. If the process does not 
      have any visible windows, the menu is disabled.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Online</dt>
      <dd>Opens the default web browser with the search engine specified in Process Hacker's options.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Terminator tests</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>TP1</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the process using the NtTerminateProcess function.</dd>
      
      <dt>TP2</dt>
      <dd>Uses the RtlCreateUserThread function to create a thread in the process which calls 
      ExitProcess, terminating the process. On Vista and above, the thread calls 
      RtlExitUserProcess.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT1</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the process' threads by using the NtTerminateThread function.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT2</dt>
      <dd>Sets the contexts of the process' threads to point to the ExitProcess function. The 
      process will be terminated when one of the threads are context switched to.</dd>
      
      <dt>TP1a</dt>
      <dd>(Windows Server 2003 and above only.) Uses NtGetNextProcess to open a handle to the process and terminate it 
      using NtTerminateProcess.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT1a</dt>
      <dd>(Windows Server 2003 and above only.) Uses NtGetNextThread to open a handle to each of the process' threads and 
      terminates them using NtTerminateThread.</dd>
      
      <dt>CH1</dt>
      <dd>Uses NtDuplicateObject to close the process' handles. This method works best for 
      complex programs.</dd>
      
      <dt>W1</dt>
      <dd>Sends WM_DESTROY messages to the process' windows.</dd>
      
      <dt>W2</dt>
      <dd>Sends WM_QUIT messages to the process' windows.</dd>
      
      <dt>TJ1</dt>
      <dd>Creates a job, assigns the process to it, and terminates the job, terminating the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>TD1</dt>
      <dd>Creates a debug object, assigns the process to it, and closes the debug object, 
      terminating the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>TP3</dt>
      <dd>Uses the internal kernel-mode function PsTerminateProcess to terminate the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT3</dt>
      <dd>Uses the internal kernel-mode function PspTerminateThreadByPointer to terminate the process' 
      threads.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT4</dt>
      <dd>Queues a kernel-mode special asynchronous procedure calls (APCs) to each of the process' threads. 
      This APC calls PspTerminateThreadByPointer to directly terminate the threads. This method will 
      terminate threads hanging due to kernel-mode code, but the system may crash or freeze because 
      kernel-mode code is not given the chance to release any resources. <strong>Use this option with 
      extreme caution.</strong></dd>
      
      <dt>M1</dt>
      <dd>Uses NtWriteVirtualMemory to write random data to the process' memory, crashing the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>M2</dt>
      <dd>Uses NtProtectVirtualMemory to prevent the process' pages from being used, crashing the process.</dd>

      drivers with low-level access to the system. This is required for hardware drivers and security software, but is 
      a mechanism through which most rootkits take control of a computer.</dd>
      <dt>Elevation (UAC)</dt>
      <dd>Under UAC, a process which is elevated has full administrative rights to system resources.</dd>
      <dt>Environment Variable</dt>
      <dd>A variable accessible to processes describing the operating system environment. Environment variables 
      are normally inherited by <em>child processes</em>.</dd>
      <dt>EtwRegistration (Object)</dt>
      <dd>An object used by Event Tracing for Windows.</dd>
      <dt>GDI</dt>
      <dd>Graphics Device Interface. This is a system which provides basic graphics support for programs.</dd>
      <dt>GDI Handles/Objects</dt>
      <dd>GDI allows programs to create drawing-related objects such as Bitmaps, Brushes, and Palettes.</dd>
      <dt>Handle</dt>
      <dd>A reference to a shared operating object or resource, e.g. a handle to an event, file or process.</dd>
      <dt>Handle leak</dt>
      <dd>Occurs when a program does not release its handles, leading to increased consumption of resources and 
      even crashes.</dd>
      <dt>Heap</dt>
      <dd>A process-managed structure from which memory can be allocated. Since <em>pages</em> can only be 
      allocated in large chunks, using a heap will reduce wastage of memory for small allocations.</dd>
      <dt>Image</dt>
      <dd>A "package" containing executable code.</dd>
      <dt>Interrupt</dt>
      <dd>An event, usually signaled by hardware, that is handled by the operating system through a 
      <em>interrupt handler</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Key (Object)</dt>
      <dd>A registry key.</dd>
      <dt>Kernel</dt>
      <dd>A collection of code that manages system-wide resources such as I/O, processes and threads, and 
      security. System calls are also handled by the kernel.</dd>
      <dt>Kernel-mode</dt>
      <dd>A processor mode in which code can access hardware directly and access all memory. For example, when 
      a <em>system call</em> is made, the processor switches to kernel-mode in order to perform an action on 
      the requester's behalf. When the system call finishes, it switches back to user-mode and the requester 
      continues normal execution.</dd>
      <dt>Kernel-mode thread</dt>
      <dd>A thread that runs solely in kernel-mode. These are usually worker threads that carry out delayed 
      operating system tasks. Most kernel-mode threads are contained in the System process, but csrss.exe also 
      runs kernel-mode threads.</dd>
      <dt>LPC</dt>
      <dd>Local inter-Process Communication (not Local Procedure Call). A Windows NT mechanism which enables 
      processes to communicate with each other. Primary consumers are system services and RPC.</dd>
      <dt>LUID</dt>
      <dd>Locally Unique IDentifier. A value which is unique on the local system until it is rebooted.</dd>
      <dt>Module</dt>
      <dd>See <em>DLL</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Mutant (Object)</dt>
      <dd>A mutex object. Win32 calls these objects mutexes, while in the Native API they are called mutants.</dd>
      <dt>Page</dt>
      <dd>A block of memory, 4 kB in size on x86 and AMD64 processors.</dd>
      <dt>PEB</dt>
      <dd>Process Environment Block. The PEB contains a variety of data used by the process.</dd>
      <dt>Privilege</dt>
      <dd>A privilege belonging to a process. It can be enabled or disabled, and certain system calls require 
      the presence of specific privileges to work.</dd>
      <dt>Process</dt>
      <dd>A collection of <em>threads</em> along with virtual memory, <em>handles</em> and other resources.</dd>
      <dt>Protection (DRM)</dt>
      <dd>Process and thread protection introduced in Windows Vista, designed to enhance support for digital 
      restrictions management. Examples of processes protected by this mechanism include System and audiodg.exe.</dd>
      <dt>Reserve</dt>
      <dd>A reserved page or memory region does not contain data and has not been allocated storage in physical 
      memory. Reserving pages is commonly done to ensure a certain amount of contiguous address space is available 
      without actually allocating storage. Compare with <em>commit</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Section (Object)</dt>
      <dd>A block of memory that can be mapped into a process' address space. The data for this block of memory can 
      be temporary ("backed" by the pagefile) or can come from a file ("backed" by a file, i.e. file mapping). Win32 
      calls these objects "file mappings".</dd>
      <dt>Service</dt>
      <dd>A operating system managed program which runs in the background. They can be in shared processes 
      (in svchost.exe instances), in separate processes, or drivers loaded into kernel-mode space.</dd>
      <dt>SID</dt>
      <dd>Security IDentifier. A unique identifier assigned to security-related objects such as users and groups.</dd>
      <dt>String</dt>
      <dd>A sequence of characters - text.</dd>
      <dt>System Call</dt>
      <dd>A request that is made by a thread to the <em>kernel</em> to perform a task on the thread's behalf. This done 
      because most threads run in user-mode and are unable to access hardware directly. See <em>kernel-mode</em>.</dd>
      <dt>System Thread</dt>
      <dd>See <em>kernel-mode thread</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Thread</dt>
      <dd>A unit of execution belonging to a process, running code concurrently. Most threads run in <em>user-mode</em>, 
      but some are <em>kernel-mode threads</em>.</dd>
      <dt>TmEn (Object)</dt>
      <dd>Enlistment objects (for the transaction manager).</dd>
      <dt>TmRm (Object)</dt>
      <dd>Resource Manager objects (for the transaction manager).</dd>
      <dt>TmTm (Object)</dt>
      <dd>Transaction Manager objects. These have an associated log file.</dd>
      <dt>TmTx (Object)</dt>
      <dd>Transaction objects (for the transaction manager).</dd>
      <dt>User Account Control</dt>
      <dd>Refers to restrictions on normal processes preventing them from modifying system-wide files and settings. 
      Processes which are <em>elevated</em> have full administrative access to system resources.</dd>
      <dt>Virtualization (UAC)</dt>
      <dd>A technology which redirects writes to the file system and registry for processes which are not 
      <em>elevated</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Working set</dt>
      <dd>The collection of <em>pages</em> recently referenced by a process. These pages are in physical 
      memory, while other pages may be in the pagefile.</dd>
      <dt>WOW64</dt>
      <dd>A technology which enables 32-bit programs to run on 64-bit Windows systems.</dd>
